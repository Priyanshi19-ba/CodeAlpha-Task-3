Objective:The objective of this project is to create a simple rule-based chatbot that interacts with users through basic text input and output. The chatbot responds to specific user messages (like "hello", "how are you", "bye") with predefined replies, using conditional statements and functions. This project helps in practicing fundamental programming concepts such as if-elif statements, functions, loops, and handling user input/output in Python.

**Key Activities:**
1.Rule-Based Responses:
The chatbot uses a simple rule-based approach, where specific user inputs trigger predefined responses. This demonstrates how basic conversational bots operate without AI or machine learning.
2.Input Normalization:
User input is converted to lowercase (.lower()), making the bot case-insensitive and improving the user experience by accepting variations like "Hello", "HELLO", or "hello".
3.Continuous Interaction:
The chatbot runs in a loop (while True), allowing for ongoing conversation until the user types "bye" to exit. This models a real chat session.
4.Conditional Logic:
The program uses if-elif-else statements to check for known phrases and provide appropriate responses, showcasing fundamental decision-making in programming.
5.Handling Unknown Inputs:
If the user enters something the bot doesnâ€™t recognize, it responds with a default message ("Sorry, I don't understand that."), which is a common feature in chatbots to handle unexpected inputs.
6.Simple and User-Friendly:
The interface is straightforward, making it easy for beginners to understand how chatbots work and how user input can be processed and responded to in real time.

**Technologies Used:**
1.Python Programming Language:
The entire chatbot is written in Python, a beginner-friendly and versatile language commonly used for scripting and automation.
2.Python Standard Library:
Input/Output Functions:
Uses input() for receiving user messages and print() for displaying bot responses in the console.
String Methods:
The .lower() method is used to normalize user input, making the chatbot case-insensitive.
Control Flow Statements:
Utilizes while loops for continuous interaction and if-elif-else statements for rule-based response logic.
3.No External Libraries or Frameworks:
This chatbot does not use any external packages like ChatterBot or machine learning libraries. It relies solely on basic Python features and logic.
4.Console-Based Interaction:
All communication happens via the command line, making it simple and accessible for beginners.

**Key Insights:**
1.Rule-Based Logic:
The chatbot uses simple rule-based logic with if-elif-else statements to match user input to predefined responses. This is the foundation of most basic chatbots, where each possible input is mapped to a specific reply.
2.Continuous Conversation:
The use of a while loop allows the chatbot to maintain an ongoing conversation, responding to multiple user inputs until the user decides to exit by typing "bye".
3.Input Normalization:
By converting user input to lowercase, the chatbot becomes case-insensitive, improving usability and ensuring consistent matching regardless of how the user types their message.
4.Handling Unknown Inputs:
The bot provides a default response ("Sorry, I don't understand that.") for any input it does not recognize, which is a standard practice in chatbot design to handle unexpected or unsupported queries.
5.User-Friendly Console Interaction:
All interactions occur through simple console input and output, making the chatbot accessible and easy to use for beginners.
6.No AI or NLP:
Unlike advanced chatbots that use artificial intelligence or natural language processing (NLP), this program relies solely on exact text matching and does not understand user intent beyond the predefined rules.
